Difference between the two is that, Coach mark comes out automatically, and has a separate connection between the view; whereas Tooltip comes out after a user action, and has a more harmony connection with the view.

## Coach marks

Coach mark comes out automatically. User can tap anywhere on the screen to dismiss coach marks. Once the coach mark is dismissed, it will NOT appear again in the same session.

</Row>

### UI suggestion 

- Size and position of the component could be adjusted based on the context
- Use coach marks sparingly, suggest to let it ONLY appear after a page transition
- Avoid more than once in a session, because it might affect userâ€™s flow of a task, for good reasons

## Speech bubble
